For every number less than n :

Check if it is a palindrome in base 10
If yes, then convert it into base k
Check if it is palindrom in base k
If yes, then add it in sum.
for number as large as 1000000, it checks for every number.
If k = 2, then a palindrome in base 2 can only be odd number, 
which might reduce the comparisons to 1000000 / 2 = 500000
